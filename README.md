Developing a Brian Tumor Detection app that uses deep learning to classify brain tumors


## What is a brain tumor?
Accumulation, mass, or growth of abnormal cells in the brain. The tumor can be benign or malignant. Malignant brain tumors are often rare, roughly 1-2% of all cancer types. 

## Overview 
The aim is to build a multi-class classification based convolutional neural network to classify 3 different types of brain tumors as well as normal cases (ones without tumors).
The categories are glioma, meningioma, pituitary, and no tumor. 

This project will use the Brain Tumor MRI Dataset from Kaggle.

### Gliomas
Account for around 1/3 of all brain tumors. Gliomas orignate in the glial cells that surround the brain's neurons. A glioma can hinder brain function and potentially be life-threatening based on its location or growth.
