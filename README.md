Developing a Brian Tumor Detection app that uses deep learning to classify brain tumors


## What is a brain tumor?
Accumulation, mass, or growth of abnormal cells in the brain. The tumor can be benign or malignant. Malignant brain tumors are often rare, roughly 1-2% of all cancer types. 

## Overview 
The aim is to build a multi-class classification based convolutional neural network to classify 3 different types of brain tumors as well as normal cases (ones without tumors).
